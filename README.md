# Courses, Workshops & Certificates


This repository contains some courses or workshops I passed and certificates I received. It is dedicated to those who love certificates!

## Why I made this repository?
I firmly believe nothing else could elevate your skills except experiences, but since we don't have Bernard's watch to freeze and extend our time, we could boost the learning process in other ways. The main reason that I created this repository is to log the valuable courses I took. Even if you have learned or experienced most topics, it could connect the points or wrap up the issues. (Thanks to them, that give certificates too!)
